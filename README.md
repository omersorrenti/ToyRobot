# ToyRobot 
I created this project following the specifications at:
https://github.com/nandowalter-lm/toy_robot

In development I used the interfaces to have a low dependency between the classes (Loosely Coupled) and tried to respect the solid principles like Single responsability and Open / closed.

I also added a test project, where I try to perform the main tests on the Robot component's methods.

If necessary in ToyRoboot.Behavior.Test project,  install nutget packages:
 - MSTest.TestAdapter 1.4.0
 - MSTest.TestFramework 1.4.0
